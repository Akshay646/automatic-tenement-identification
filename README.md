# Automatic Tenement Identification

## Overview
Automated service for grouping spatial units into tenements using graph algorithms, reducing manual work by 40%.

## Problem Statement
Manual tenement grouping in large 3D models is laborious, error-prone, and non-scalable.

## Existing System
Manual grouping and naming of spaces in architectural models, leading to inefficiencies.

## Proposed Solution
Graph-based connected components detection automates tenement formation.

## Technical Approach
- Input: 3D spatial model
- Graph construction of spaces and connections
- BFS to find connected components
- Output: Tenement groups and updated model

## Results
- Reduced manual effort by ~40%
- Improved accuracy and scalability

## Tech Stack
C#, .NET, Microservices, Graph Algorithms
