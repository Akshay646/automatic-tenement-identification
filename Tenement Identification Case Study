Automatic Tenement Identification — Case Study
Company Name | [Month, Year] – Present

Problem Statement
In architectural and construction workflows, creating and managing tenements (groups of spatial units such as residential or commercial spaces) within large-scale 3D building models is a critical but time-consuming task. Traditionally, architects and modelers manually group rooms or spaces into tenements and assign names or classifications. This manual process is:

Highly labor-intensive, often consuming up to 60% of the model preparation time.

Prone to human error and inconsistency.

Difficult to scale for buildings with hundreds of floors and thousands of spaces.

Given the increasing complexity and size of building information models, there was a clear need to automate tenement identification to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.

Existing System
The existing system relied heavily on manual intervention:

Architects would place individual rooms or spaces within the 3D model.

They manually created tenements by grouping these spaces based on their judgment and project requirements.

Naming and organizing these groups was also performed manually.

There was no automated verification or optimization, resulting in significant time consumption and potential errors.

This approach lacked scalability and was inefficient for high-density building projects.

Proposed Solution
We designed and developed an automated backend service to identify and form tenement groups directly from spatial data within the building model, eliminating the need for manual grouping.

The key insight was to model the problem as a graph connectivity challenge, where:

Nodes represent individual spatial units (rooms, spaces).

Edges represent connections between spaces via architectural elements such as doors or openings, indicating accessibility.

By applying graph traversal algorithms to this model, the system automatically detects clusters of connected spaces that constitute a tenement.

Technical Approach
Input Processing
The service accepts a 3D building model file as input and extracts spatial units and their connectivity data based on architectural elements (doors, openings).

Graph Construction
Each space is represented as a node, and edges are created for each identified connection between spaces.

Connected Components Detection
The algorithm performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph to identify connected components, where each connected component corresponds to a tenement.

Tenement Formation
Using domain-specific rules (e.g., room types like residential or commercial), the service groups spaces within each connected component into tenements.

Output Generation
The system outputs an updated model with tenements created and an accompanying JSON file detailing the tenement groups and their constituent spaces.

Benefits and Impact
Metric	Before	After
Manual Grouping Effort	High (~60% of model preparation time)	Reduced by approximately 40%
Accuracy	Subject to human error and inconsistency	Deterministic and consistent results
Scalability	Challenging for large, complex models	Fully automated and scalable solution
Time Efficiency	Limited by manual processes	Significantly improved workflow speed

This automation dramatically reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and enables architects and engineers to focus on higher-value tasks.

Technologies Used
C# and .NET for backend service development

Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability

Graph algorithms (BFS) for spatial connectivity analysis

Summary
By reframing the problem of tenement identification as a graph connectivity challenge and applying well-established graph algorithms, we successfully automated a previously manual, error-prone task. This solution delivers significant time savings and improved scalability in managing large and complex spatial building models.
